              <h2>The Project</h2>

              “Composition NHV” is a collaborative Public Humanities project conceived as part of Introduction to Public Humanities, a Spring 2023 course at Yale University.
              
              We have sought to implement a collaborative workflow rooted in consensus-based decision-making on issues that relate to the project as a whole including the project's design, content, and team roles.
